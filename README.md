## Communal living

### Cooking Rota

On the _closed door outside the kitchen_, there is a cooking rota. Each Saturday, we will draw up the rota for the following 7 days. It is considered the norm for 2 people to cook on any given evening.

### General Kitty

There is a general kitty used to buy food and household essentials such as toilet paper and cleaning products. The current _expected contribution_ is 25  ₪ (šql) per day. There is a chart on the _closed door outside the kitchen_, where each person must tick the days for which they have paid. Each Saturday, we will redraw the chart for the following 7 days.
**It is important for us to pay into the General Kitty _in advance_ to avoid leaving people out of pocket.**

### Beer Tally System

There is a beer tally on the _closed door outside the kitchen_. When you take a beer, add a line to your tally. When you pay off your debt to the beer kitty, cross off your tally - and start again. Beers are currently priced at 3  ₪ (šql) each, that is the price at which they are bought from the _supermarket by Mary's Well_.
**It is important to take back the bottles and crate when buy new beers, in order to get the best price**

## Useful Tips

### Bad Weather
During periods of abject weather, it is considered _not uncommon_ for rain water to leak through the window in the roof, at the point where the _hallway_ joins the _living area_. In such a situation it is considered the norm to strategically place plastic containers on the ground _in order to prevent the formation_ of potentially hazardous pools of rain water. Furthermore, it is generally considered _unadvisable_ to store personal items, such as shoes or bags, in this area during such periods.
