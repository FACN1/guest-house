## Communal living

### Cooking Rota

On the _closed door outside the kitchen_, there is a cooking rota. Each Saturday, we will draw up the rota for the following 7 days. It is considered the norm for 2 people to cook on any given evening.

### General Kitty

There is a general kitty used to buy food and household essentials such as toilet paper and cleaning products. The current _expected contribution_ is 25 Å¡ql per day. There is a chart on the _closed door outside the kitchen_, where each person must tick the days for which they have paid. Each Saturday, we will redraw the chart for the following 7 days.
**It is important for us to pay into the General Kitty _in advance_ to avoid leaving people out of pocket.**

### Beer Tally System

There is a beer tally on the _closed door outside the kitchen_. When you take a beer, add a line to your tally. When you pay off your debt to the beer kitty, cross off your tally - and start again.
